The Radiation - WDI PROJECT 1

Overview:

The Radiation is a collective portfolio where members can showcase their creative
work to a community of people interested in creative collaboration and dialogue.
It is designed to function as a collaborative, living archive of all types of
creative media.  It serves the purpose of providing interested people with an
open, online meeting place for creative expression and dialogue without having to go
through standard editorial channels.

Details:

The home page selects a random post from the list of all posts.  
The "Our Work" page aggregates all posts published by members.  
Individual posts may accessed and commented via the posts#show route, and all posts
published by a particular user may be accessed via the users#show route.  

In addition to writing blog-style posts, users may embed Soundcloud, Youtube, Vimeo
players as well as attach photos to individual posts.

Current list of supported embed links:

Soundcloud iframe embed links
Youtube video URLS
Vimeo video URLS

In the future I would like to add a calendar for events, a Instagram feed from
members, support for multiple attachments, grid based css framework,
javascript integration, and a more robust / rich text content management system.
